First, we are declaring a string array variable. This will be used to store the result which will be returned by the File.ReadAllLines method.
Next, we use the File.ReadAllLines method to read all the lines from our text file. The result is then passed to the lines variable.
Since we know that our file contains only 2 lines, we can access the value of the array variables via the lines[0] and lines[1] command.
